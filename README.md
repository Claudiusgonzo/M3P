# M3P

This repo provides the code of M3P a Multitask Multilingual Multimodal Pre-trained model that combines multilingual-monomodal pre-training and monolingual-multimodal pre-training into a unified framework via multitask learning and weight sharing. The model learns universal representations that can map objects that occurred in different modalities or expressed in different languages to vectors in a common semantic space. To verify the generalization capability of M3P, the pre-trained model can be applied for different types of downstream tasks: multilingual image-text retrieval, multilingual image captioning, multimodal machine translation, multilingual natural language inference and multilingual text generation.
